# LSF Corpus Project 🌐🤟

Welcome to the **LSF Corpus Project**! This initiative aims to build a comprehensive dataset of **Langue des Signes Française (LSF)**, or French Sign Language, to help train AI models for sign language recognition.

Our mission is to improve **accessibility** and **inclusion** for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community by enabling more efficient communication using technology. 🚀

## About the Project 📖

The **LSF Corpus Project** is dedicated to creating a high-quality, **open-source** dataset that will be used to train AI models for recognizing sign language. The project starts by focusing on capturing images of individual letters in LSF, specifically the **dactylology system** (finger-spelling), which is a key component of French Sign Language.

This dataset will allow us to develop more accurate and efficient AI models that can recognize signed letters and eventually expand to recognizing full LSF signs, helping bridge the communication gap between hearing and deaf individuals. 🤝

## How It Works 🛠️

The process to contribute is simple and quick! Here’s how you can get involved:

### Step 1: Review the Tutorial 📚
Before you start, take a moment to read our **tutorial**. It will guide you through how to take clear and accurate photos of LSF letters.

### Step 2: Capture Images 📸
Once you're ready, sign a letter of the LSF alphabet in front of your webcam. A reference image will appear on your screen, showing you the letter you need to sign. You will have **10 seconds** to capture multiple images, one every second, to ensure high-quality data for the model. ⏱️

### Step 3: Submit Your Contribution 📥
Your photos will be automatically submitted to enrich the LSF dataset. Each contribution is important for training the AI model and advancing the project. 🌱

### Step 4: Enjoy Exclusive Benefits 🎁
The top 3 contributors will receive **exclusive access** to the app once it’s fully developed. Additionally, all contributors will receive **regular updates** via email, keeping you informed about the progress and improvements made to the project. 📧

## Contribute 🤗

You can make a **difference** by contributing to the LSF dataset! Whether you're signing the letters of the alphabet or sharing the project with others, your involvement will help improve the accuracy of AI models and foster greater inclusion for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. 💡

To get started, simply sign up on the platform, follow the tutorial, and start capturing your photos. **Every contribution counts!** 🙌

## Benefits for Contributors 🎉

- **Exclusive access** to the app for the top 3 contributors once it's live.
- **Updates and progress reports**: Stay informed with regular emails about the development of the project.
- **Impactful involvement**: Your photos will play a key role in improving AI-based sign language recognition. 💪
